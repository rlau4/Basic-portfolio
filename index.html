    <p>Hi! My name is Robert Lau, but everyone calls me Peter. I was born and raised in Birmingham, Alabama, but currently reside in Orlando, Florida. I grew up with 5 brothers and sisters. Having such a large family was challenging growing up but I wouldn't change any looking back on it. Having such a large family taught me many things and shaped who I am today. Using the tab above, you can view my portfolio. There might not be much on there now but trust me I will be hard at work filling it up. I strive to get into the video game community and industry. Whether that be throug creation of actual video games or through helping content creators. If you have any questions or commnets for me feel free to use the contact tab!</p>
